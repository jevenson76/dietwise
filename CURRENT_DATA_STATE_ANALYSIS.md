### **Database Schema (What WILL be created):**
```sql
Tables that will be created when first used:
├── dietwise_users          (User accounts & profiles)
├── health_profiles         (Encrypted health data) 
├── dietary_preferences     (Food preferences & restrictions)
├── meal_plans             (AI-generated meal plans)

├── user_analytics         (Usage metrics & progress)
└── stripe_subscriptions   (Premium subscription data)
```

**Row Level Security:** ✅ Fully implemented - Users only see their own data

## 💾 **Local Storage Data (Browser-Based)**

### **What Gets Stored Locally:**
When someone uses the app, this data is created **in their browser only**:

| Data Type | localStorage Key | Purpose | Sample Data |
|-----------|------------------|---------|-------------|
| **User Profile** | `userProfile` | Personal info | Age: 30, Weight: 150lbs, Goal: 140lbs |
| **Food Log** | `foodLog` | Daily meals | Breakfast: Oatmeal 300cal, Lunch: Salad 250cal |
| **Weight Log** | `actualWeightLog` | Weight tracking | [{date: "2025-01-01", weight: 150}, ...] |
| **Custom Foods** | `myFoods` | User recipes | "My Protein Shake: 25g protein, 200cal" |
| **Custom Meals** | `myMeals` | Meal combos | "My Breakfast Bowl: oatmeal + berries" |
| **Achievements** | `milestones` | Progress tracking | "First 7-day streak achieved!" |
| **Settings** | `reminderSettings` | Notifications | Breakfast reminder: 8:00 AM |
| **Theme** | `appTheme` | UI preference | "dark" or "light" |
| **Auth Token** | `authToken` | Login session | JWT token (if registered) |

### **Data Ownership:**
- ✅ **Individual ownership** - Each browser creates its own data
- ✅ **No shared data** - No access to other users' information  
- ✅ **Local-first** - Works completely offline in browser
- ✅ **Optional cloud sync** - Can backup to database if user registers

## 👤 **Default Data (What Users Start With)**

### **New User Experience:**
```javascript
// Default empty profile
defaultUserProfile = {
  name: null,              // User must enter
  email: null,             // User must enter
  age: null,               // User must enter
  sex: null,               // User must select
  height: { ft: null, in: null },  // User must enter
  weight: null,            // User must enter
  activityLevel: null,     // User must select
  targetWeight: null,      // User must set goal
  targetDate: null,        // User must set timeline
}

// Default empty logs
foodLog = []              // No existing food entries
weightLog = []            // No existing weight entries
myFoods = []              // No custom foods
myMeals = []              // No custom meals
```

### **System Defaults (Pre-configured):**
```javascript
// App-wide settings
reminderSettings = {
  weighInFrequencyDays: 7,           // Weekly weigh-ins
  mealReminders: {
    breakfast: { enabled: false, time: "08:00" },
    lunch: { enabled: false, time: "12:30" },
    dinner: { enabled: false, time: "18:30" }
  }
}

// Achievement thresholds
WEIGHT_MILESTONE_INCREMENT = 5;     // Every 5 lbs lost
STREAK_MILESTONES_DAYS = [7, 30, 90, 182, 365];  // Logging streaks
TOTAL_LOGGED_MEALS_MILESTONES = [30, 100, 250, 500];  // Meal milestones
```

## 🔄 **Data Flow: What Happens When Someone Uses the App**

### **Scenario 1: Anonymous User (No Registration)**
1. **Opens app** → Gets empty default profile
2. **Enters info** → Data saved to browser localStorage only
3. **Logs food** → All data stays local to their browser
4. **Closes app** → Data persists in their browser only
5. **Reopens app** → Sees their own data from localStorage

**Data Location:** Browser only  
**Data Owner:** Individual user  
**Data Visibility:** Private to that browser session

### **Scenario 2: Registered User (With Account)**
1. **Opens app** → Gets empty default profile
2. **Creates account** → Profile synced to cloud database
3. **Logs food** → Data saved locally + synced to cloud
4. **Uses different device** → Can login and see their data
5. **Logs out** → Data remains in cloud, local data cleared

**Data Location:** Browser + Cloud database  
**Data Owner:** Individual user account  
**Data Visibility:** Private with cloud backup

## 🔒 **Data Security & Privacy**

### **Privacy Protection:**
- ✅ **No existing personal data** to be concerned about
- ✅ **Isolated user accounts** - RLS prevents cross-user access
- ✅ **Encrypted health data** - AES-256-GCM encryption at rest
- ✅ **Local-first approach** - Can use without creating account
- ✅ **GDPR compliant** - Users control their data

### **Data Encryption:**
```javascript
// Health data is encrypted before storage
health_profiles = {
  id: "uuid",
  user_id: "user_uuid", 
  encrypted_data: "AES-256-GCM encrypted blob",
  data_key: "encrypted_key",
  last_modified: "timestamp"
}
```
