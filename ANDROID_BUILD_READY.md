## Next Steps to Complete Android Build

### 1. Install Android SDK

The Android SDK needs to be installed to complete the build. Choose one option:

**Option A: Android Studio (Recommended)**
```bash
# Download Android Studio from https://developer.android.com/studio
# Install and run the setup wizard
# SDK will be automatically configured
```

**Option B: Command Line Tools Only**
```bash
# Download SDK tools from https://developer.android.com/studio#command-line-tools-only
# Extract to ~/Android/Sdk/cmdline-tools/latest/
# Set ANDROID_HOME environment variable
export ANDROID_HOME=~/Android/Sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/latest/bin:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
```

### 2. Set SDK Location

Create `android/local.properties`:
```properties
sdk.dir=/home/jevenson/Android/Sdk
```

### 3. Build Release APK/AAB

```bash
cd android

# Build APK (for direct installation)
./gradlew assembleRelease

# Build AAB (for Google Play Store)
./gradlew bundleRelease
```

### 4. Output Files

After successful build:
- **APK**: `android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`
- **AAB**: `android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`

## Security Notes ⚠️

**IMPORTANT**: The following files contain sensitive information:

```
android/keystore.properties          # Contains keystore passwords
android/app/keystore/*.keystore      # The signing keystore
```

**Never commit these to git!** They are already in `.gitignore`.

**Backup Requirements:**
1. Save `dietwise-release.keystore` file securely
2. Record passwords in a password manager
3. You CANNOT update the app without the original keystore

## Verification Steps

Once Android SDK is installed, verify the build:

```bash
# Check that keystore is valid
keytool -list -v -keystore android/app/keystore/dietwise-release.keystore -alias dietwise

# Test debug build first
cd android && ./gradlew assembleDebug

# Then try release build
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

## Current Status

✅ All configuration files ready
✅ Keystore generated and configured  
✅ Web assets built and synced
⏳ Waiting for Android SDK installation to complete build

The Android project is **100% ready** for building once the Android SDK is available on the system.
